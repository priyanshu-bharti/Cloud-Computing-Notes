-   Access control plays a crucial role in maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information and resources in the cloud.

## Access control components:

1. **Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user or entity trying to access cloud resources. It typically involves the use of usernames, passwords, tokens, or biometric factors to validate the identity.

2. **Authorization**: After authentication, the system determines what level of access the authenticated user or entity should have. Authorization is based on predefined policies and roles that specify the access privileges associated with different user categories.

3. **Access Policies**: These are rules and permissions defined by the cloud administrators to specify who can access specific resources and what actions they are allowed to perform.

4. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: A common approach to access control in cloud computing, where users are assigned specific roles based on their job functions or responsibilities, and each role is associated with certain access permissions.

5. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: An access control model that takes into consideration various attributes related to the user, resource, and environment to make access decisions. ABAC provides more fine-grained and dynamic access control compared to traditional RBAC.

6. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhances security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification, such as a password and a one-time code sent to their mobile device.

7. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: A mechanism that allows users to log in once and access multiple cloud services without the need to re-enter credentials for each service.

8. **Audit and Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring access activities and logging access attempts to detect and respond to potential security breaches.

# Security risks with access control

-   **`Privilege Escalation:`** Unauthorized users gaining higher-level access privileges than they should have, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

    - Describes the characteristics of the user attempting to access a resource.
    - Examples: username, job title, department, security clearance, etc.

2. **`Object or Resource Attributes:`**

    - Encompasses characteristics of the resource being accessed.
    - Examples: file name, data sensitivity, creation date, etc.

3. **`Environmental or Context Attributes:`**

    - Provides broader context for access requests.
    - Examples: time of access, location, device type, communication protocol, etc.

4. **`Action Attributes:`**
    - Indicates the type of action the user wants to perform on the resource.
    - Examples: read, write, view, edit, transfer, delete, etc.

## How ABAC Works

1. An access request is made.
2. The ABAC tool scans attributes to check for matching policies.
3. Based on the analysis, permission is granted or denied.

## Benefits of ABAC

# What are the components of cassandra?

![Cassandra Components](https://www.ismiletechnologies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Overview-of-cassandra_img1-1024x458.jpg)

1. **Node**: A node is a single machine or server that participates in the Cassandra cluster. Each node stores a part of the data and can communicate with other nodes to exchange data and coordinate tasks.

2. **Data-center**: A data-center is a collection of nodes physically located together. In Cassandra, you can have multiple data-centers spread across different geographical locations for replication and disaster recovery purposes.

3. **Cluster**: A cluster is a set of interconnected nodes that work together to handle data storage and processing. It can span across one or more data-centers.

4. **Commit Log**: The commit log is a durable append-only log in Cassandra. It records all write operations before they are written to the main data store (SSTables). The commit log ensures data durability and allows for data recovery in case of node failures.

5. **Memory Table**: The mem-table is an in-memory data structure that stores recent write operations. It acts as a write-back cache and holds data before it is flushed to the SSTables. This improves write performance by reducing the need to immediately write data to disk.

6. **SSTable (Sorted String Table)**: SSTables are on-disk storage files in Cassandra. Data from the mem-table is periodically flushed to SSTables. SSTables are immutable and sorted by key, providing fast read operations.

7. **Bloom Filter**: A Bloom filter is a data structure used in Cassandra to quickly determine if a particular row exists in an SSTable without reading the entire file. It helps to reduce unnecessary disk I/O during read operations, improving overall performance.

# What is Cassandra Query Language?

In simple terms, CQL allows you to:

1. **Create and Manage Tables**: You can use CQL to define the structure of your data tables, specifying column names, data types, and primary keys.

2. **Insert Data**: CQL lets you insert new data into your tables. You can add records with values for different columns.

3. **Update Data**: You can modify existing data in your tables using CQL. It allows you to change values in specific rows or columns.

4. **Retrieve Data**: CQL allows you to query and retrieve data from your tables. You can specify conditions to filter the results and get the information you need.

5. **Delete Data**: CQL enables you to remove data from your tables. You can delete specific rows or columns based on your requirements.

6. **Create Indexes**: CQL allows you to create indexes on certain columns to improve query performance.

# What is Write Operations in Cassandra?

Write operations in Cassandra involve:

1. **Inserting Data**: When you want to add new information to the database, you perform an insert operation. It's like writing a new entry in the notebook.

2. **Updating Data**: If you need to change some information that is already written in the database, you perform an update operation. It's like making corrections or changes to what you've written before.

1. **In-Memory Data Storage**: Data is stored in RAM for faster access and processing.

2. **Data Partitioning**: Data is divided into smaller partitions and distributed across nodes in a cluster.

3. **Data Processing**: Operations are performed in parallel across all nodes, leveraging distributed computing.

4. **Distributed Compute Engine**: Powerful engine for complex computations across the entire cluster.

5. **In-Memory Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached for accelerated access.

6. **Real-Time Processing**: Designed for high-throughput, low-latency real-time data processing.

7. **Scalability**: Easily scalable by adding more nodes to the cluster.

8. **Fault Tolerance**: Data replication ensures high availability even in the event of node failures.
