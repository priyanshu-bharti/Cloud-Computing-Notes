# [MapReducer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9mX04IvFRA)

MapReduce is a distributed data processing model in cloud computing, designed for handling large-scale datasets efficiently.

1. **`Data Storage`**: Input data stored in cloud's distributed file system for easy accessibility.

2. **`Mapping`**: Input dataset divided into splits and processed independently by multiple mappers on VMs. Mappers apply user-defined Map function, creating intermediate key-value pairs.

3. **`Shuffling and Sorting`**: Intermediate key-value pairs shuffled and sorted based on keys across the cloud cluster.

4. **`Reducing`**: Reducer tasks process shuffled key-value pairs. They apply user-defined Reduce function to aggregate or compute data associated with each key.

5. **`Data Output`**: Final output stored in cloud's distributed file system, accessible for further analysis.

## Benefits of MapReduce in Cloud Computing:

-   **`Scalability:`** Cloud platforms can dynamically provision resources to handle varying workloads.

-   **`Fault Tolerance:`** Cloud-based MapReduce handles task failures by automatically rescheduling tasks on other nodes.

-   **`Cost-effectiveness:`** Cloud's pay-as-you-go pricing model makes MapReduce more cost-effective than on-premises clusters.

-   **`Elasticity:`** Cloud environments quickly allocate additional resources, efficiently handling peak workloads.

# Explain Architecture of MapReduce:

![MapReduce Architecture](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200908123810/MapReduce-Architecture.jpg)

Components of MapReduce Architecture

1. **Client**: Submits MapReduce jobs for processing to the Hadoop MapReduce Manager.

2. **Job**: The actual work or task that the client wants to execute, comprising multiple smaller tasks.

3. **Hadoop MapReduce Master**: Divides the job into subsequent job parts.

4. **Job-Parts**: The task or sub-jobs obtained after dividing the main job. The results of all job-parts are combined to produce the final output.

5. **Input Data**: The dataset provided to MapReduce for processing.

6. **Output Data**: The final result obtained after MapReduce processing.

## MapReduce Task Phases

**`Map Phase:`**

-   Maps input data into key-value pairs.

-   Executes the Map() function on each input key-value pair.

-   Generates intermediate key-value pairs for the Reducer.

**`Reduce Phase:`**

-   Shuffles and sorts intermediate key-value pairs.

-   Executes the Reduce() function to aggregate or group data based on keys.

**`Job Tracker:`**

-   Manages resources and jobs across the cluster.

-   Schedules each map on the Task Tracker running on the same data node.

**`Task Tracker:`**

-   Executes Map and Reduce tasks as instructed by the Job Tracker.

-   Deployed on each node in the cluster, working as slaves.

**`Job History Server`**

-   Stores historical information about tasks or applications.

-   Saves logs generated during or after job execution.

# Twister vs MapReduce vs Iterative Twister

## MapReduce:

-   MapReduce is a distributed data processing model designed for parallel processing of large-scale datasets across a cluster of commodity hardware.

-   It was popularized by Google and later implemented in Apache Hadoop. The core idea of MapReduce is to split data into smaller chunks, process them in parallel, and then combine the results to produce the final output.

### Key Features:

-   Divides tasks into two phases: Map and Reduce.

-   Scalable, fault-tolerant, and suitable for batch processing.

-   Generally used for one-time batch data processing jobs.

-   Requires storing intermediate results on disk, which can cause performance overhead.

## Twister:

-   Twister is another data processing model and framework designed to provide real-time and iterative data processing capabilities in addition to batch processing.

-   It was inspired by MapReduce but focuses on providing more flexible, efficient, and low-latency data processing solutions for various applications.

### Key Features:

-   Supports both batch and real-time data processing.

-   Utilizes iterative MapReduce to reduce communication and storage overhead in iterative algorithms.

-   Efficient for streaming data and low-latency applications.

-   Achieves better performance for certain iterative algorithms compared to traditional MapReduce.

## Iterative Twister:

-   Iterative Twister is an extension of the Twister data processing framework, specifically designed for handling iterative algorithms more efficiently. -

-   Iterative algorithms are computations that require multiple iterations to converge to a solution, common in machine learning and graph processing.

### Key Features:

-   Optimized for iterative algorithms to reduce overhead during repeated computations.

-   Retains data in memory across iterations, minimizing disk I/O.

-   Enables faster convergence of iterative algorithms compared to traditional MapReduce or even Twister for these specific tasks.

-   Particularly useful for machine learning algorithms like K-means clustering, PageRank, etc.

# Performance issues in Twister:

Common performance issues in Twister in cloud computing environments include:

1. **`Data Transfer Overhead:`** Frequent data transfers between nodes leading to increased latency and overhead.

2. **`Network Latency:`** Higher network latency impacting data shuffling and communication.

3. **`Resource Contentions:`** Competing for resources can result in uneven performance.

4. **`Elasticity Challenges:`** Dynamically adding/removing resources causing performance fluctuations.

5. **`Disk I/O:`** Cloud storage limitations affecting data storage and retrieval during processing.

6. **`Data Skew:`** Imbalanced processing due to uneven data distribution.

7. **`Instance Type and Configuration:`** Performance variations based on instance types and configurations.

8. **`Overhead in Real-Time Processing:`** Challenges in achieving low-latency real-time processing.

9. **`Synchronization and Coordination:`** Overhead in iterative algorithms due to synchronization and coordination.

# What is Hadoop:
